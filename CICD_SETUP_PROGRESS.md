# CI/CD Setup Progress

## What We've Done:
1. Created backup repo: shopmate-new-backup
2. Copied all working code from snyk/testing branch
3. Created clean git history (removed corruption)
4. Set up branch structure:
   - main (base)
   - dev (auto-deploy)
   - stage (manual approval) 
   - production (2 approvals)

## Next Steps:
1. ✅ Add 3 workflow files to .github/workflows/:
   - ✅ dev.yml (auto-deploy on push to dev)
   - ✅ stage.yml (manual approval for staging)
   - ✅ production.yml (manual approval for production)
2. Set GitHub secrets: AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID, AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY
3. Create GitHub environments: staging, production
4. Set branch protection rules

## Workflow: feature → dev → stage → production

## Current Status: Workflow files created, ready for GitHub setup
